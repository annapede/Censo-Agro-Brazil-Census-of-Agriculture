# In this repository I explore IBGE's Agriculture Census data on census workers trajectory in rural areas. 

# Data can be downloaded at: https://censos.ibge.gov.br/agro/2017/resultados-censo-agro-2017/trajetos-dos-recenseadores.html

#This georeferenced data was made available for the first time in the 2017 census.

# In this repository I estimate the maximun distance, within each brazilian municipality, between the points visited by the census workers. 

# This estimate can produce a measure of each brazilian municipality rural area extension.
